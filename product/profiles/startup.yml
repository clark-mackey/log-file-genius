  Optimized for fast-moving startups, MVP development, and rapid prototyping.
  Emphasizes speed and minimal documentation overhead while maintaining essential context.
  Perfect for pre-product-market-fit startups, hackathons, and rapid experimentation.

# Use cases
use_cases:
  - Pre-product-market-fit startups
  - MVP development and rapid prototyping
  - Hackathons and time-boxed projects
  - Early-stage product exploration
  - Fast-moving small teams (2-5 people)
  - Pivot-heavy development

# Token targets - Reduced limits for speed
token_targets:
  # CHANGELOG limits - Smaller for rapid iteration
  changelog_warning: 6000      # Warn at 6,000 tokens (80% of 7.5k target)
  changelog_error: 7500        # Error at 7,500 tokens (reduced from 10k)
  
  # DEVLOG limits - Smaller for speed
  devlog_warning: 8000         # Warn at 8,000 tokens (80% of 10k target)
  devlog_error: 10000          # Error at 10,000 tokens (reduced from 15k)
  
  # Combined limits - Smaller overall
  combined_warning: 14000      # Warn at 14,000 tokens (80% of 17.5k target)
  combined_error: 17500        # Error at 17,500 tokens (reduced from 25k)
  
  # STATE limits - Same as other profiles
  state_warning: 400           # Warn at 400 tokens (80% of 500 target)
  state_error: 500             # Error at 500 tokens

# Required files - Minimal requirements
required_files:
  - CHANGELOG                  # Always required (track what changed)
  # DEVLOG optional (skip for speed)
  # ADR optional (skip for speed)
  # STATE optional (skip for speed)
  # PRD optional (skip for speed)

# Update frequency - Minimal overhead
update_frequency:
  changelog: every-commit      # Update CHANGELOG on every commit (track changes)
  devlog: optional             # Skip DEVLOG for speed
  state: optional              # Skip STATE for speed
  adr: optional                # Skip ADRs for speed (revisit post-PMF)
  prd: optional                # Skip PRD for speed (revisit post-PMF)

# Validation - Minimal enforcement
validation:
  strictness: warnings-only    # Show warnings but never fail (don't block speed)
  format_validation: true      # Validate CHANGELOG format (keep it clean)
  token_validation: true       # Validate token counts (prevent bloat)
  crosslink_validation: false  # Skip cross-link validation
  fail_on_warnings: false      # Never fail on warnings (speed over perfection)

# Archival - Aggressive archival for speed
archival:
  changelog_age_days: 14       # Archive CHANGELOG entries older than 14 days (aggressive)
  devlog_age_days: 7           # Archive DEVLOG entries older than 7 days (aggressive)
  auto_archive_on_warning: true   # Auto-archive on warnings (keep it lean)
  auto_archive_on_error: true     # Auto-archive on errors (keep it lean)
  archive_directory: project/planning/archive  # Archive location

# AI assistant behavior - Maximum speed
ai_assistant:
  proactive_updates: true      # AI should proactively update planning files
  require_confirmation: false  # Don't ask before updating (maximize speed)
  show_checklist: false        # Skip checklist (maximize speed)
  suggest_validation: false    # Skip validation suggestion (maximize speed)

# Startup-specific guidance
startup_guidance: |
  Startups should focus on:
  
  1. **Speed Over Perfection:**
     - CHANGELOG is enough for most changes
     - Skip DEVLOG until you find product-market fit
     - Skip ADRs until architecture stabilizes
     - Skip STATE unless team coordination requires it
  
  2. **When to Upgrade:**
     - **Found PMF?** → Switch to `team` profile
     - **Hiring?** → Switch to `team` profile
     - **Open-sourcing?** → Switch to `open-source` profile
     - **Scaling?** → Switch to `team` profile
  
  3. **What to Track:**
     - Track what changed (CHANGELOG)
     - Track why you pivoted (DEVLOG - optional)
     - Track major decisions (ADR - optional)
     - Skip everything else until you need it
  
  4. **Pivot-Friendly:**
     - Aggressive archival keeps docs lean during pivots
     - CHANGELOG tracks what you tried
     - Easy to restart with clean slate if needed

# Customization tips
customization_tips: |
  Startups can customize this profile:
  
  - **Even faster:** Set `validation.strictness: disabled` to skip all validation
  - **More context:** Set `devlog: milestones-only` to document major pivots
  - **Team coordination:** Add `STATE` to `required_files` for daily standups
  - **Post-PMF:** Switch to `team` profile when ready to scale
  
  To customize, copy this file to your project root as `.logfile-config.yml` and modify.
