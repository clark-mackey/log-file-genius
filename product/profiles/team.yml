  - Medium to large codebases (10k-100k LOC)

# Token targets - Same as solo, but enforced more strictly
token_targets:
  # CHANGELOG limits
  changelog_warning: 8000      # Warn at 8,000 tokens (80% of 10k target)

  # DEVLOG limits
  devlog_warning: 12000        # Warn at 12,000 tokens (80% of 15k target)
  devlog_error: 15000          # Error at 15,000 tokens
  
  # Combined limits (CHANGELOG + DEVLOG)
  combined_warning: 20000      # Warn at 20,000 tokens (80% of 25k target)
  combined_error: 25000        # Error at 25,000 tokens
  
  # STATE limits (optional file)
  state_warning: 400           # Warn at 400 tokens (80% of 500 target)
  state_error: 500             # Error at 500 tokens

# Required files - More comprehensive for team context
required_files:
  - CHANGELOG                  # Always required

  - ADR                        # Required for architectural decisions
  # STATE optional but recommended
  # PRD optional but recommended

# Update frequency - More frequent for team coordination
update_frequency:
  changelog: every-commit      # Update CHANGELOG on every commit
  devlog: significant-changes  # Update DEVLOG for features, breaking changes, major fixes
  state: daily                 # Update STATE daily for team visibility
  adr: as-needed               # Create ADRs for architectural decisions
  prd: as-needed               # Create PRD when planning major features

# Validation - Enforce errors, allow warnings
validation:
  strictness: errors           # Fail on errors, allow warnings
  format_validation: true      # Validate CHANGELOG/DEVLOG format
  token_validation: true       # Validate token counts
  crosslink_validation: false  # Skip cross-link validation (future feature)
  fail_on_warnings: false      # Allow warnings (don't block commits)

# Archival - Longer retention for team history
archival:
  changelog_age_days: 60       # Archive CHANGELOG entries older than 60 days
  devlog_age_days: 30          # Archive DEVLOG entries older than 30 days
  auto_archive_on_warning: false  # Don't auto-archive on warnings
  auto_archive_on_error: true     # Auto-archive when hitting error threshold
  archive_directory: project/planning/archive  # Archive location

# AI assistant behavior - Proactive but visible
ai_assistant:
  proactive_updates: true      # AI should proactively update planning files
  require_confirmation: false  # Don't ask before updating (trust but verify)
  show_checklist: true         # Show pre-commit checklist
  suggest_validation: true     # Suggest running validation before commits

# Team-specific guidance
team_guidance: |
  Teams should establish conventions for:
  
  1. **DEVLOG Ownership:** Who writes DEVLOG entries? (PR author, tech lead, rotating)
  2. **ADR Process:** When to create ADRs? (before implementation, during design review)
  3. **STATE Updates:** Who updates STATE? (daily standup, rotating, tech lead)
  4. **Review Process:** Should planning files be reviewed in PRs? (recommended: yes)
  5. **Archival Cadence:** Who archives old entries? (monthly, quarterly, automated)
  
  Document your team's conventions in DEVLOG "Current Context" section.

# Customization tips
customization_tips: |
  Teams can customize this profile to match their workflow:
  
  - **Stricter validation:** Set `validation.strictness: strict` to fail on warnings
  - **More frequent DEVLOG:** Set `devlog: every-commit` for high-context teams
  - **Require STATE:** Add `STATE` to `required_files` for daily standup visibility
  - **Longer retention:** Increase `archival.changelog_age_days` to 90 for audit trails
  
  To customize, copy this file to your project root as `.logfile-config.yml` and modify.
