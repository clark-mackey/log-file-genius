## Active Work

- **Agent-1** (main): Reviewing and testing bulk operations endpoint PR #90
- **Agent-2** (feature/websocket-pooling): Implementing connection pooling for WebSocket manager
- **Developer-1** (feature/task-notifications): Adding email notifications for task assignments

---

## Blockers

- **Agent-2:** Load testing tools not yet configured - need to validate WebSocket pooling performance before merge
- **Developer-1:** Email service credentials pending from DevOps team

---

## Recently Completed (Last 2-4 Hours)

- ✅ Fixed WebSocket memory leak with heartbeat mechanism (Agent-2, 14:30) - Shipped v0.3.2
- ✅ Added database indexes for task queries (Agent-1, 15:15) - Shipped v0.3.1
- ✅ Implemented optimistic locking for task updates (Agent-1, 15:45) - Shipped v0.3.1
- ✅ Updated error responses to RFC 7807 format (Developer-1, 16:00)

---

## Next Priorities

1. **Complete WebSocket connection pooling** - Agent-2 to finish implementation and add tests
2. **Set up load testing** - DevOps to configure k6 or Locust for WebSocket testing
3. **Merge bulk operations endpoint** - Agent-1 to approve PR #90 after testing
4. **Configure email service** - DevOps to provide SMTP credentials for notifications
5. **Performance testing** - Test with 1000+ concurrent WebSocket connections

---

## Branch Status

- **main**: Clean, all tests passing (last deploy: v0.3.2 at 14:45)
- **feature/websocket-pooling**: 4 commits ahead, tests passing, needs load testing before merge
- **feature/bulk-operations**: 3 commits ahead, tests passing, in code review
- **feature/task-notifications**: 2 commits ahead, blocked on email credentials

## Recent Deployments

- **v0.3.2** - Deployed to staging at 14:45 UTC (WebSocket memory leak fix)
- **v0.3.1** - Deployed to staging at 15:50 UTC (optimistic locking, performance fixes)
- **Production** - Running v0.3.0 (real-time updates via WebSocket)

---

## Known Issues

- WebSocket connection count monitoring shows occasional spikes - investigating if this is real or monitoring artifact
- Database query performance degrading slightly with >50k tasks per user - may need partitioning in future
- Mobile app team reported occasional WebSocket disconnects on iOS - investigating network timeout settings
