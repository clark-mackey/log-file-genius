## Template Guidelines (Remove this section after initial setup)

### Entry Format
```markdown
- **Feature/Change Name** - One-line description. Files: `path/to/file.py`. PR: [#1234](link)
```

### Best Practices for AI Efficiency

1. **One line per change** - Keep it scannable
2. **Always include file paths** - Helps AI locate relevant code
3. **Link to PRs/issues** - Deep context available on demand, not loaded upfront
4. **No code examples** - Link to files instead
5. **No "Why This Matters"** - That belongs in DEVLOG
6. **Archive monthly** - Move versions >30 days old to `/archive/CHANGELOG-YYYY-MM.md`

### Categories (Keep a Changelog Standard)

- **Added** - New features
- **Changed** - Changes to existing functionality
- **Deprecated** - Soon-to-be-removed features
- **Removed** - Removed features
- **Fixed** - Bug fixes
- **Security** - Security fixes

### Token Efficiency Target

- **Current entry:** 60-80 tokens
- **Entire file:** <10,000 tokens (with archival strategy)
- **Archive trigger:** Versions older than 30 days
