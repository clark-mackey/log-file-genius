# Augment Rule Improvements - October 2025

## Problem Statement

The original Augment rules for log file maintenance were not triggering automatic updates to CHANGELOG and DEVLOG files. The agent would only update planning files when explicitly asked, rather than proactively updating them before commits.

### Root Cause

The rules were **passive guidance** rather than **active automation**:
- They described what *should* happen but didn't enforce it
- They lacked explicit trigger points and verification steps
- They didn't include accountability mechanisms
- The language was suggestive ("should", "after") rather than imperative ("MUST", "BEFORE")

---

## Solution: Improved Rules

### 1. log-file-maintenance.md (Always Active)

**Key Improvements:**

#### Before (Passive):
```markdown
### After Every Commit
- **CHANGELOG entries:** Add single-line entry in "Unreleased" section
```

#### After (Active):
```markdown
## üî¥ BEFORE EVERY COMMIT - REQUIRED CHECKLIST

**Before running `git commit`, you MUST complete ALL of these steps:**

### Step 1: Update CHANGELOG.md (REQUIRED)
1. Open `docs/planning/CHANGELOG.md`
2. Add entry in the appropriate category under "Unreleased" section
3. Use format: `- Description. Files: \`path/to/file\`. Commit: \`hash\``

### Step 4: Verify Before Committing
**Show this checklist to the user BEFORE committing:**

‚úÖ Pre-Commit Checklist:
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md updated with entry for this change
- [ ] DEVLOG.md updated (if milestone/decision)
- [ ] Planning files added to commit
- [ ] Commit message is clear and descriptive
- [ ] Ready to commit
```

**Changes Made:**
- ‚úÖ Changed timing from "AFTER" to "BEFORE" commits
- ‚úÖ Added mandatory checklist that must be shown to user
- ‚úÖ Made language imperative (MUST, REQUIRED, NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- ‚úÖ Added verification step after committing
- ‚úÖ Included planning files IN the same commit (not separate)
- ‚úÖ Added "Common Mistakes to Avoid" section with examples
- ‚úÖ Added "Success Criteria" to verify correct behavior

**Why This Works Better:**
1. **Timing:** Updating BEFORE commits ensures planning files are always in sync
2. **Accountability:** Checklist forces agent to confirm completion
3. **Visibility:** User sees what's being updated before commit happens
4. **Atomic commits:** Planning files and code changes in same commit
5. **Clear expectations:** No ambiguity about what's required

### 2. status-update.md (Manual Command)

**Key Improvements:**

#### Before (Vague):
```markdown
When I say "status update", analyze these files and provide a brief summary
```

#### After (Specific):
```markdown
## Trigger
When the user says **"@status update"** or **"status update"**, execute this command.

### Step 1: Read These Files (in parallel)
- `docs/planning/DEVLOG.md` ‚Üí "Current Context (Source of Truth)" section
- `docs/planning/CHANGELOG.md` ‚Üí "Unreleased" section

### Step 3: Format the Output
Use this exact format:
[Specific markdown template provided]
```

**Changes Made:**
- ‚úÖ Explicit trigger phrases ("@status update" or "status update")
- ‚úÖ Step-by-step process (Read ‚Üí Extract ‚Üí Format)
- ‚úÖ Exact output format template
- ‚úÖ Specific file sections to read
- ‚úÖ Example output showing expected result

**Why This Works Better:**
1. **Consistency:** Same format every time
2. **Efficiency:** Parallel file reading
3. **Completeness:** All key information included
4. **Clarity:** User knows exactly what to expect

### 3. update-planning-docs.md (Manual Command)

**Key Improvements:**

#### Before (Generic):
```markdown
When updating planning documentation, follow the process defined in `docs/log_file_how_to.md`
```

#### After (Interactive):
```markdown
### Step 1: Ask What Needs Updating
Present these options:
1. **CHANGELOG** - Add technical change entries
2. **DEVLOG** - Add decision/milestone narrative
3. **DEVLOG Current Context** - Update project state
4. **ADR** - Create architectural decision record
5. **All of the above** - Comprehensive update

### Step 2: Execute Based on Choice
[Detailed instructions for each option]

### Step 3: Offer to Commit
After updating files, ask:
1. Commit these changes now
2. Let you review first
3. Include in your next commit
```

**Changes Made:**
- ‚úÖ Interactive menu system (1-5 options)
- ‚úÖ Specific instructions for each document type
- ‚úÖ Example entries for each format
- ‚úÖ Commit workflow integration
- ‚úÖ Tips section with best practices

**Why This Works Better:**
1. **Guided workflow:** User chooses what to update
2. **Specific formats:** Examples for each document type
3. **Flexible:** Can update one or all documents
4. **Integrated:** Offers to commit after updates

## Implementation Notes

### File Locations

**Local (your workspace):**
- `.augment/rules/log-file-maintenance.md` (improved version)
- `.augment/rules/status-update.md` (improved version)
- `.augment/rules/update-planning-docs.md` (improved version)

**Starter Pack (for distribution):**
- `starter-packs/augment/.augment/rules/log-file-maintenance.md` (improved version)
- `starter-packs/augment/.augment/rules/status-update.md` (improved version)
- `starter-packs/augment/.augment/rules/update-planning-docs.md` (improved version)

### Testing the Improvements

To verify the new rules work:

1. **Make a code change**
2. **Prepare to commit**
3. **Agent should automatically:**
   - Update CHANGELOG.md
   - Update DEVLOG.md (if milestone)
   - Show pre-commit checklist
   - Add planning files to commit
   - Confirm updates after commit

If the agent doesn't do this automatically, the rules aren't being followed correctly.

## Expected Behavior Changes

### Before Improvements:
- ‚ùå Agent commits code without updating planning files
- ‚ùå User has to say "update planning docs" manually
- ‚ùå Planning files updated in separate commits
- ‚ùå No verification that updates happened
- ‚ùå Inconsistent update patterns

### After Improvements:
- ‚úÖ Agent updates planning files BEFORE every commit
- ‚úÖ Agent shows pre-commit checklist for verification
- ‚úÖ Planning files included IN the same commit
- ‚úÖ Agent confirms what was updated after commit
- ‚úÖ Consistent, predictable behavior

---

## Limitations

Even with improved rules, there are still limitations:

1. **Rules are guidance, not code:** The agent still needs to interpret and follow them
2. **No enforcement mechanism:** If the agent ignores the rules, there's no automatic penalty
3. **Depends on agent capability:** The agent must be capable of following multi-step instructions
4. **User can override:** User can still commit without updates if they choose

### For True Automation:

If you want **guaranteed** automatic updates, consider:
- **Git hooks:** Pre-commit scripts that enforce updates
- **CI/CD checks:** Verify planning files are updated in PRs
- **Custom tooling:** Scripts that update planning files automatically

---

## Rollout Plan

1. ‚úÖ Update local `.augment/rules/` with improved versions
2. ‚úÖ Update `starter-packs/augment/.augment/rules/` with improved versions
3. ‚è≥ Test with next commit to verify behavior
4. ‚è≥ Update CHANGELOG and DEVLOG to document the improvements
5. ‚è≥ Commit and push improved rules to GitHub
6. ‚è≥ Monitor agent behavior over next few commits

---

## Success Metrics

**The improvements are successful if:**
- ‚úÖ Agent updates CHANGELOG before every commit (100% compliance)
- ‚úÖ Agent shows pre-commit checklist before committing
- ‚úÖ Planning files are always in sync with code changes
- ‚úÖ User doesn't need to manually request planning file updates
- ‚úÖ DEVLOG entries are created for all milestones/decisions

---

## Feedback Loop

After using the improved rules for a week:
1. Review commit history - were planning files updated consistently?
2. Check CHANGELOG/DEVLOG - are entries complete and accurate?
3. Note any times the agent didn't follow the rules
4. Refine rules based on observed behavior
5. Document any additional improvements needed
