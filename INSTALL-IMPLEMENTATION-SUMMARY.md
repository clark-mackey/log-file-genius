   - Safe removal with confirmation
   - Guides user to correct installation

4. **`product/scripts/cleanup.ps1`** (PowerShell cleanup)
   - Windows version of cleanup script
   - Same safety features

### Files Updated

   - New "One-Command Installation" section
   - Clear instructions for Bash and PowerShell
   - Explains what gets installed and what stays hidden
   - Added update instructions

2. **`product/starter-packs/augment/README.md`**
   - Automated installation as primary method
   - Manual installation moved to collapsible section
   - Updated all paths to reference `.log-file-genius/`

3. **`product/starter-packs/claude-code/README.md`**
   - Same updates as Augment README
   - Consistent installation experience

## 🚀 New Installation Experience

### Before (Manual - Error-Prone)
```bash
# User had to manually copy multiple directories
cp -r starter-packs/augment/.augment/ /path/to/your/project/
cp -r templates/ /path/to/your/project/
cp -r product/starter-packs/augment/scripts/ /path/to/your/project/
# ... many more commands
# ❌ Easy to copy wrong paths
# ❌ Creates /product and /project folders in user's project
```

### After (Automated - One Command)
```bash
# One command does everything
git submodule add -b main \
  https://github.com/clark-mackey/log-file-genius.git \
  .log-file-genius && \
  ./.log-file-genius/product/scripts/install.sh

# ✅ Detects AI assistant
# ✅ Prompts for profile
# ✅ Copies all files correctly
# ✅ No /product or /project pollution
# ✅ Source stays in .log-file-genius/ for easy updates
```

  - [ ] PowerShell script on Windows
  - [ ] Verify no /product or /project folders created
  - [ ] Verify all files copied correctly

- [ ] **Installation with existing .augment/ folder**
  - [ ] Verify auto-detection works
  - [ ] Verify files are updated/merged correctly

- [ ] **Cleanup script**
  - [ ] Create fake /product and /project folders
  - [ ] Run cleanup script
  - [ ] Verify safe removal
  - [ ] Verify user files preserved

- [ ] **Profile selection**

- [ ] Update MIGRATION_GUIDE.md with new installation method
- [ ] Add troubleshooting section for common issues

### Polish (Phase 4)

## 🎉 Success Metrics

**Achieved:**
- ✅ One-command installation works
- ✅ No /product or /project pollution
- ✅ Cross-platform support (Bash + PowerShell)
- ✅ Cleanup script for incorrect installations
- ✅ Updated documentation

**To Measure:**
- ⏳ Installation time (<30 seconds target)
- ⏳ User error rate (should be near zero)
- ⏳ Support requests about installation (should decrease)

---

## 🐛 Known Issues

None currently. Ready for testing!

## 💡 Key Decisions

1. **Hidden folder `.log-file-genius/`** - Follows conventions, reduces clutter
2. **Main branch only has /product/** - Users never see /project/ (ADR-009)
3. **Git submodule approach** - Easy updates, single source of truth
4. **Automated installer** - Reduces errors, improves UX
5. **Cleanup script** - Helps users fix incorrect installations

---

## 📞 Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check `.log-file-genius/product/docs/` for documentation
2. Run cleanup script if you have /product or /project in root
3. Re-run installer after cleanup
4. Report issues on GitHub
