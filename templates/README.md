## How to Use These Templates

### Quick Start

1. **Copy templates to your project:**
   ```bash
   cp templates/CHANGELOG_template.md docs/planning/CHANGELOG.md
   cp templates/DEVLOG_template.md docs/planning/DEVLOG.md
   cp templates/STATE_template.md docs/planning/STATE.md
   cp templates/ADR_template.md docs/adr/ADR_template.md
   ```

2. **Customize the frontmatter:**
   - Update cross-links to match your directory structure
   - Adjust relative paths based on your file locations

3. **Remove template guidelines:**
   - Delete the "Template Guidelines" section at the bottom of each file
   - Keep only the actual template content

4. **Start documenting:**
   - Add your first CHANGELOG entry
   - Write your first DEVLOG entry
   - Create your first ADR when needed
   - Update STATE.md if using multi-agent workflow

### Directory Structure

## Customization Tips

### Adjust Token Budgets

Scale token targets based on your project size:

**Small projects (<10k LOC):**
- CHANGELOG: <5,000 tokens
- DEVLOG: <8,000 tokens
- STATE: <300 tokens

**Medium projects (10k-100k LOC):**
- CHANGELOG: <10,000 tokens
- DEVLOG: <15,000 tokens
- STATE: <500 tokens

**Large projects (>100k LOC):**
- CHANGELOG: <15,000 tokens
- DEVLOG: <20,000 tokens
- STATE: <800 tokens

### Adjust Update Cadence

Adapt to your team's workflow:

**Solo developer:**
- CHANGELOG: After each commit
- DEVLOG: After milestones
- STATE: Optional (use DEVLOG Current Context instead)

**Small team (2-5 people):**
- CHANGELOG: After each commit
- DEVLOG: Weekly Current Context updates, entries after milestones
- STATE: Optional but helpful

**Multi-agent environment:**
- CHANGELOG: After each commit
- DEVLOG: Weekly Current Context updates, entries after milestones
- STATE: Critical - update every 30-60 minutes during active work

## Questions?

- **What's the difference between DEVLOG and CHANGELOG?**
  - CHANGELOG = What changed (facts only)
  - DEVLOG = Why it changed (narrative and reasoning)

- **When should I create an ADR?**
  - For decisions with long-term impact that are hard to reverse
  - Technology choices, security decisions, API design
  - Not for bug fixes or minor implementation details

- **Do I need STATE.md?**
  - Optional for solo developers (use DEVLOG Current Context instead)
  - Recommended for teams and multi-agent environments
  - Critical for preventing conflicts in concurrent workflows

- **How often should I archive old entries?**
  - CHANGELOG: Archive entries older than 30 days
  - DEVLOG: Archive entries older than 14 days
  - STATE: Archive to CHANGELOG after 24 hours
