## Active Work

- **Agent-1** (main): Implementing user authentication flow
- **Agent-2** (feature/api-v2): Refactoring REST endpoints for v2 API
- **Developer-1** (feature/dashboard): Building analytics dashboard UI

---

## Blockers

- Database migration script needs review before deployment (blocks Agent-1)
- API v2 specification awaiting stakeholder approval (blocks Agent-2)
- Chart.js integration issues with reactive state (blocks Developer-1)

---

## Recently Completed (Last 2-4 Hours)

- ✅ User model updated with email verification fields (Agent-1, 12:45)
- ✅ Test suite passing on main branch (Agent-2, 13:30)
- ✅ Fixed CORS configuration for staging environment (Developer-1, 14:00)

---

## Next Priorities

1. Merge feature/auth-flow after OAuth2 tests pass
2. Review and approve database migration script
3. Complete API v2 endpoint refactoring
4. Resolve Chart.js integration issues or switch to alternative library

---

## Branch Status

- **main**: Clean, all tests passing, ready for merges
- **feature/auth-flow**: 3 commits ahead, tests passing, ready for review
- **feature/api-v2**: 7 commits ahead, 2 failing tests, needs work
- **feature/dashboard**: 5 commits ahead, blocked on Chart.js issue

## Token Budget Dashboard (Optional)

- **STATE.md**: ~450 tokens (target: <500)
- **CHANGELOG**: ~8,200 tokens (target: <10,000)
- **DEVLOG**: ~12,500 tokens (target: <15,000)
- **Combined logs**: ~21,150 tokens (target: <25,000)

## Template Guidelines (Remove this section in actual use)

### When to Update STATE.md

**Update at START of work session:**
- Add yourself to "Active Work" section
- Check for blockers that might affect your work
- Verify no conflicts with other agents' active work

**Update DURING work session:**
- Every 30-60 minutes with progress updates
- Immediately when blocked (add to "Blockers" section)
- When completing significant milestones

**Update at END of work session:**
- Move your task from "Active Work" to "Recently Completed"
- Update branch status
- Clear any blockers you resolved

### Best Practices for Multi-Agent Coordination

1. **Read STATE.md FIRST** - Before starting any work
2. **Update immediately** - Don't batch updates, keep it fresh
3. **Be specific** - "Implementing auth" is vague, "Adding OAuth2 PKCE flow" is clear
4. **Include timestamps** - Helps agents understand recency
5. **Archive to CHANGELOG** - Move "Recently Completed" items older than 24 hours to CHANGELOG
6. **Keep it under 500 tokens** - This is a snapshot, not a history

### What Belongs in STATE.md vs DEVLOG vs CHANGELOG

**STATE.md (this file):**
- What's happening RIGHT NOW (last 2-4 hours)
- Who's working on what
- Current blockers
- Immediate next steps
- Branch status

**DEVLOG:**
- Why decisions were made
- Narrative of project evolution
- Lessons learned
- Context for future reference
- Current Context section (updated weekly)

**CHANGELOG:**
- What changed (facts only)
- Version history
- File paths and PR links
- Completed features and fixes

### Token Efficiency Target

- **Target:** <500 tokens (roughly 300-400 words)
- **Update frequency:** Every 30-60 minutes during active work
- **Archive trigger:** Move "Recently Completed" items older than 24 hours to CHANGELOG
- **Freshness:** Should always reflect last 2-4 hours of activity

### Multi-Agent Workflow Example

**Agent-1 starts work:**
1. Reads STATE.md → sees Agent-2 is working on API endpoints
2. Adds to "Active Work": "Agent-1 (feature/auth): Adding OAuth2 support"
3. Checks "Blockers" → none affect auth work
4. Proceeds with work

**Agent-1 during work:**
1. Every 30-60 minutes: Updates progress in "Active Work" section
2. Hits blocker: Adds to "Blockers" section immediately
3. Resolves blocker: Removes from "Blockers" section

**Agent-1 completes work:**
1. Moves task from "Active Work" to "Recently Completed" with timestamp
2. Updates "Branch Status" for feature/auth branch
3. Updates "Next Priorities" if needed
4. Commits changes to STATE.md

**Next day:**
1. Agent-2 archives "Recently Completed" items older than 24 hours to CHANGELOG
2. STATE.md stays fresh and lightweight

### Example Entry Formats

**Active Work:**

- Waiting for design mockups for dashboard UI (blocks Developer-2)
```

**Recently Completed:**

- ✅ Payment bug fixed, deployed to staging (Developer-1, 15:00)
```

**Branch Status:**
```markdown
- **main**: Clean, all tests passing (last updated: 15:30)
